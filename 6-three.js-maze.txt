Develop a simple 3D game using Three.js where the player navigates a procedurally generated maze. The maze should be created programmatically with walls and a floor, all rendered as basic geometric shapes (e.g., cubes or planes) without any imported assets.
The player controls a first-person camera with WASD keys and mouse-look functionality. Add a goal (e.g., a glowing sphere) that the player must reach to win, and display a 'You Win' message on screen when they succeed. Compare how two models generate the Three.js scene setup, camera controls, collision detection, and procedural maze algorithm, focusing on performance and playability.
