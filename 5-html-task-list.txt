Create a website application that allows users to manage a personal task list. The application should include a front-end interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a back-end that stores tasks in a JSON file as a simple database. Users should be able to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete. Include features like sorting tasks by priority
(low, medium, high) and filtering by completion status. Ensure the JSON file is updated in real-time as tasks are modified, and provide a clean, responsive Ul with a modern design.
